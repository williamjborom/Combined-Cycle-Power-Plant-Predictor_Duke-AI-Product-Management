# Combined-Cycle-Power-Plant-Predictor_Duke-AI-Product-Management

In this short project, which is part of Duke's AI Product Management Course on Coursera, I will be trying some different modeling techniques on power plant data. The goal is to gather insights about what controibutes or takes away from creating
as much load as possible form a base load.

## Data

The dataset can be downloaded from this link: https://storage.googleapis.com/aipi_datasets/CCPP_data.csv

The variables included are:

AP - Ambient Pressure
T - Temperature
RH - Relative Humidity
EV - Exhaust Vacuum

And the output variable PE - Net Hourly Electrical Output.
